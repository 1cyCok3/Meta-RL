# Meta-RL
Implementation of Meta-RL A3C algorithm taken from [Learning to Reinforcement Learn](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05763). 
For more information, as well as explainations of each of the experiments, see my corresponding [Medium post](https://medium.com/p/b15b592a2ddf).

Contains iPython notebooks for:

* **Dependent Bandit tasks** - described in paper.
* **Contextual Bandit task** - using randomized  MNIST digits to indicate reward-giving arm in each episode. 
* **Rainbow Gridworld task** - Variation of gridworld in which goal colors are randomzied each episode and must be learned "on the fly."
